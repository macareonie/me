    "ingredients": [
      "Pork mince",
      "Holy Basil",
      "Garlic",
      "Oyster Sauce",
      "Fish Sauce",
      "Light Soy Sauce"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Prepare the chilli paste by grinding chilli padi and garlic in a mortar and pestle. Adjust the quantities according to your own spice tolerance. Using a food processor or simply mincing it with a knife are possible alternatives",
      "Heat a dash oil in a pan and fry the chilli paste for about a minute or two. Do avoid getting the fumes in your eyes",
      "Add the pork mince and break it up well and allow to brown evenly",
      "Add oyster sauce, fish sauce and soy sauce according to taste and mix well",
      "Once the mince is cooked, turn off the heat add stir basil leaves through the stir-fry"
    ],
    "closingRemarks": "Best served over rice alongside a fried egg. Pork mince can be replaced with mince or chunks of other protein like chicken or beef. Firm tofu could also work as a meat-free option. Holy basil can be hard to fine, in which case regular basil works fine.",
