            I believe cooking is an invaluable life skill that everyone should
            have and honestly I personally think that it is not hard as well.
            Cooking at its simplest is essentially just reading and following a
            recipe step-by-step.

            This food blog will showcase several tips and tricks I've picked up
            from Youtube and various online recipes ever since the Covid-19
            pandemic which prompted my self-teaching homecooking journey.
            Included will be some of my go-to recipes for meals I personally
            cook at home, as well as some more adventurous recipes I've
            attempted. Enjoy!

            Disclaimer: Most of the recipes do not have exact steps or
            measurements as I mainly cook of feel and vibes. The pictures used
            below are also mostly from online sources. The ones that I took
            myself shoudl be pretty obvious ðŸ¥². Food photography is clearly
            something I have not learnt yet. Hopefully, one day...
